# Find PC Parts

I just saw [this](https://github.com/ViniciusLovato/autoblog-search) and thought I could mimic (or maybe consume it) using Spring.
The only reason I'm using Spring for this is because that's what I'm learning.
And the reason I copied an ideia from Vini Lovato is that it's difficult to have cool ideas and this looks like a cool (and public) idea. 

## Prereq

You need to configure an instance of the [autoblog-search](https://github.com/ViniciusLovato/autoblog-search) on the properties (TODO - for now just run on the port 3000).

## Running

To run: 
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To build and run:
```
./mvnw package
 java -jar target/*.jar
```
